## Description

<ul>
<li>
The motivation behind this project was to refactor an existing webpage to meet ADA and accessibility criteria for end-users that might be using non-traditional methods to view/ interact with the webpage. 
</li>
<li>
The goal here was to identify generic tag elements and specify them further to semantic HTML to make comprehension and flow understandable for all end-users.
</li>
<li>
This activity taught me how important it is to analyze the code and associated styling css on a webpage
</li>
</ul>

## Installation

<ol>
<li>
In order to begin this project, we must first be able to view the source code. In order to do this, we must first open up VSCode (Visual Studio Code) and past the existing code into it.
</li>
<li>
Next we open a browser capable of inspecting and viewing the web page further: could be something like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
</li>
<li>
After we have the code visibly viewable, we're able to analyze the HTML further to see where the flaws in accessibility lay, as well as what the corresponding CSS stylesheet is doing to the HTML.
</li>
<li>
After we have the browswer open, VSCode open, and source codes viewable - we're able to begin the process of refactoring.
</li>
</ol>

## USER STORY
As a marketing agency:
I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
So that our own site is optimized for search engines

 ## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Credits

The collaborators on this project included cohort member, Achilles, instructor Eric Weiss, and TA Michael Kotte. 

The resource that I first started with on this project was an in-depth review of html semantic tags through [W3 Schools][1] to get refamiliarized with all of the specific semantic tags and element selectors. Next I dove into why and when it is appropriate to use those tags through a [Youtube Tutorial][2]. After viewing the first two links, I thought it would be best practices to look further into the accessibility standards and SOPs that are ADA compliant through [Accessibility Standards][3]. 

If not viewable, the links to those sites can be found in this README document that is viewable as 'text-only'.
